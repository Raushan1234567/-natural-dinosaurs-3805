## link for server

https://nordstorm-db-json.onrender.com/

# To run our project you have to start the server

run json-server --watch db.json

## to run server

json-server --watch db.json

## To run the website without any issues

To run the website without any issues you have to run the server locally because we tried to deploy the server on render but render is not getting updated automatically.
